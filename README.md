# Hacker-News
Hacker-news clone is is an attempt to clone some of the functionalities of Hacker News public API i.e [Link](https://github.com/HackerNews/API).
By providing REST API endpoints in it.

The api's are written in [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/).

#### Postman Collection
Link: [https://www.getpostman.com/collections/37dfb6e88c84d12417b4](https://www.getpostman.com/collections/37dfb6e88c84d12417b4)

## Installation

### Prerequisites 
a) Install Docker and Kubernetes

b) Kubernetes configured with ingress-nginx for the specific OS - 
  - Tutorial: [link](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/#docker-for-mac)

c) Adding our custom host name to the the "hosts" file of your OS. -
  - To run locally need to add the host name available in [ingress.srv.yaml](https://github.com/Shubhamjain2908/hackernewshub/blob/master/infra/k8s/ingress-srv.yaml) file to be added in the host file of a particular OS.
  - In our case map "hn-hub.dev" to "127.0.0.1". refer: [link](https://support.rackspace.com/how-to/modify-your-hosts-file/).

d) Skaffold (for feasibility & quick deployment process) - 
  - Move to the root directory of the project & run.
  - #### skaffold dev

cheers :)
Now you will see the logs of all the services running up.

You can access the API's on your local from (works only on your local system) - https://hn-hub.dev.

Over time complexity and scope of your factory increases, but old code, I mean old machines, are still there, getting in the way.<p>You can choose to ignore it and work around it using underground belts and similar solutions, or you can take on a proper refactoring, limiting your progress in the short term.",
            "username": "flixic",

 ## Troubleshooting
While running the services you might find then there are some services which are failing to start or sending an error for TCP connection. 
It happens when one of the dependent deployment finishes early then the other one, In that case you need to restart the pod, run: ```kubectl get pods``` (to get the pods name) & then to restart the depl just delete that pod with ```kubectl delete POD_NAME```
